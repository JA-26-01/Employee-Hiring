# Employee-Hiring

An attempt to make a model which is able to predict whether a candidate will be hired or not, based on certain attributes like education level, gender, age, skill set, etc.

Exploratory Data Analysis has been performed to find out the relationship between the predictor and the target attributes, which helped in figuring out if there is any bias present in the data or not. Different classification models haeve been trained and tested and the one with the best performance has been used as the final classifier.
